# ThreadedPrime
#
# This was a simple programming challenge given at an interview. I had one hour to create and application that
# calculates the largest prime possible in 60 seconds time, and then prints that out (with the printer). The UI
# had to remain responsive, and thus background workers were used for threading. I believe this took 45 minutes.
